# Hot Reload vs Hot Restart
    Hot Reload: This feature allows you to inject code changes into the running app without restarting the whole app. It is perfect for quickly seeing UI changes without losing the app state.
    Hot Restart: This fully restarts the app, losing any current state and reinitializing the app from scratch. This is useful when you want to ensure that all code changes are applied correctly, especially when modifying the app's state or app lifecycle.
